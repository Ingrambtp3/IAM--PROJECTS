# 🛡️Week 2 IAM Project: Scenario-Based Remediation 🛡️ 
## Project Title 💻
**Over-Privileged Access Remediation and Access Review Setup**

## Scenario 🚀
During an internal audit, a test user account was found with Global Administrator privileges in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). This posed a significant security risk and required immediate remediation to enforce the principle of least privilege.

## Objective 🕵🏾
- Identify and remove excessive privileges from the test account.
- Implement Access Reviews to monitor privileged role assignments.
- Enable Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for secure and controlled administrative access.

## Steps Taken⚡️
1. Reviewed the test account’s current role assignments in the Entra ID portal.
2. Removed the Global Administrator role from the test account.
3. Reassigned the account to a less privileged role appropriate for testing (e.g., User Administrator).
4. Set up Access Reviews for privileged roles to ensure continuous auditing.
5. Enabled Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for all administrative roles.
6. Documented findings, actions taken, and updated internal IAM best practices.

## Outcome
✅ Successfully removed excessive permissions, reducing security risk.

✅ Access Reviews and PIM to maintain least privilege and enforce periodic review of privileged access.

✅Improved documentation and operational processes for ongoing IAM governance.

## Lessons Learned
✅Over-privileged accounts significantly increase organizational risk and must be addressed promptly.

✅Access Reviews and PIM are essential tools for sustaining a secure IAM environment.

✅Consistent documentation ensures security processes are scalable and repeatable.
