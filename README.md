# 🛡️ Identity & Access Management (IAM) Labs – By The BYTEKAGE

Welcome to my IAM project series — a hands-on portfolio designed to showcase real-world Identity and Access Management implementations using Microsoft Entra ID, Auth0, PowerShell, and Microsoft Graph API.

These labs reflect my practical experience and professional growth as I transition deeper into the IAM space, building the technical skills required to design, secure, and automate modern identity systems.

🧠 I'm not just learning — I'm executing.  
📈 I'm not just documenting — I'm building.  
🌍 I'm not just growing — I'm showing the path for others breaking into tech.

---

## 🎯 Why These Labs Matter

- Every project simulates a real-world scenario an IAM engineer or security analyst would face
- Each lab reinforces identity governance, automation, role-based access control, SSO, and more
- I use these labs to deepen my own mastery **and** to help others see what it looks like to do the work that earns the role

Whether you're a hiring manager, aspiring IAM pro, or someone curious about what identity looks like in action — this repo shows the receipts.

# 🔐 Week 8 – SAML SSO Lab: Auth0 (IdP) → Microsoft Entra ID (SP)

In this lab, I configured a SAML-based Single Sign-On (SSO) flow using **Auth0 as the Identity Provider (IdP)** and **Microsoft Entra ID as the Service Provider (SP)**. I manually set up the SAML integration by exporting metadata from Auth0, uploading the X.509 signing certificate into Entra, and defining the ACS and Entity ID settings. After assigning a test user in Entra, I confirmed the flow end-to-end using an IdP-initiated login that redirected to a custom GitHub Pages landing page.

---

## ✅ Key Topics Covered

- SAML 2.0 protocol fundamentals: NameID, ACS URL, Entity ID
- Identity federation between Auth0 and Entra ID
- X.509 certificate trust setup in Entra
- Redirect handling and custom post-login landing pages
- Real-world SSO lab structure and documentation

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Auth0 (SAML IdP)
- Microsoft Entra ID (SAML SP)
- X.509 Certificates
- GitHub Pages

---

## 🔐 Outcome

This project shows how to federate identity between a third-party IdP and Microsoft Entra using SAML 2.0. It simulates real enterprise SSO setups and reinforces identity federation, assertion handling, and trust relationships across platforms.

# 🔐 Week 9 – Hybrid Identity Lab: bytekagelab.local → Microsoft Entra ID

In this lab, I created a hybrid identity environment by deploying a Windows Server 2019 VM in Azure and configuring it as a domain controller (`bytekagelab.local`). I installed Azure AD Connect and synced on-prem AD users to Microsoft Entra ID. This simulates how organizations bridge legacy identity infrastructure with cloud-based directories.

---

## ✅ Key Topics Covered

- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) configuration
- Azure AD Connect setup and sync
- PowerShell-based manual sync triggering
- Troubleshooting module import and sync cmdlets
- Hybrid identity architecture in real-world environments

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Windows Server 2019 (Azure VM)
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- Azure AD Connect
- Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)
- PowerShell

---

## 🔐 Outcome

This project demonstrates how hybrid identity works by integrating on-prem AD with Microsoft Entra. I gained hands-on experience with directory synchronization, identity provisioning, and PowerShell troubleshooting — replicating enterprise IAM workflows.

# 🔐 Week 10 – Hybrid Identity Access Governance: Group-Based App Provisioning

In this lab, I extended my hybrid identity environment by implementing role-based access control (RBAC) and automated cloud app provisioning. I created security groups in on-prem Active Directory, synced them to Microsoft Entra ID using Azure AD Connect, and assigned these groups to the ServiceNow app. I then added test users to the on-prem groups and verified that access was automatically granted in the cloud.

---

## ✅ Key Topics Covered

- On-prem AD security group creation and structure  
- Azure AD Connect group synchronization  
- Enterprise application assignment to groups in Microsoft Entra  
- Automatic cloud access provisioning through group membership  
- Real-world RBAC and onboarding simulation

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Windows Server 2019 (Azure VM)  
- Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)  
- Azure AD Connect  
- Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)  
- ServiceNow (Enterprise App)

---

## 🔐 Outcome

This project showcases how organizations can automate access provisioning using group-based role assignments. By linking on-prem group membership to cloud app access through Entra ID, I simulated a real-world identity governance flow that improves onboarding efficiency and enforces least privilege.

### 🧩 WEEK 11 – Keycloak IAM Lifecycle (Joiner–Mover–Leaver)

Built a **full IAM lifecycle simulation** inside **Keycloak + Docker**, covering the **Joiner → Mover → Leaver** process used in enterprise identity governance.  
Implemented **RBAC**, **MFA**, **SSO (OIDC)**, and **audit logging** to demonstrate how identity, security, and compliance work together.

🔑 **Skills Practiced:**  
Keycloak | Docker | JML Lifecycle | RBAC | MFA | SSO (OIDC) | Audit Governance  

💡 **Focus:**  
Lifecycle automation, Zero Trust enforcement, and troubleshooting real-world IAM issues like misconfigured redirect URIs and disabled accounts.

 ### 🔐 Week 12 – Okta ⇄ Salesforce Lifecycle Automation (SSO + Provisioning)

In this lab, I integrated **Okta** with **Salesforce** to automate the full **Joiner–Mover–Leaver (JML)** identity lifecycle.  
This project brings together **SAML SSO** for secure authentication and **SCIM provisioning (OAuth)** for seamless user management — exactly how real enterprises connect SaaS platforms to their identity providers.

✅ Key Topics Covered 
- Configured SAML SSO between Okta (IdP) and Salesforce (SP)  
- Enabled SCIM provisioning via OAuth for automated user creation, updates, and deactivation  
- Implemented Joiner, Mover, and Leaver scenarios to simulate real identity lifecycle events  
- Verified updates through Okta System Logs and Salesforce user records  

 🧰 Tools & Technologies 
Okta | Salesforce | SAML | SCIM | OAuth | Lifecycle Management  

 💡 Focus 
Demonstrated how identity automation eliminates manual onboarding/offboarding, reduces data exposure risk, and ensures compliance.  
By the end of this lab, Okta was the single source of truth — creating, updating, and disabling Salesforce users in real time based on profile changes.

# 🔐 Week 13 – Entra ID as IdP: SAML SSO App Onboarding

In this lab, I onboarded a SaaS app to Microsoft Entra ID using SAML 2.0 SSO, with Entra as the identity provider. I configured the Entity ID, ACS URL, and NameID, exchanged the signing certificate, and enforced access with `Assignment required`. Along the way I found and fixed a signing-certificate trust mismatch, and used Entra sign-in logs to isolate an app-side failure. The lab is mapped to NIST SP 800-53 (AC-2, AC-3, AC-6, IA-2, IA-5(2), SC-12, AU-6) and CySA+ topics, and comes with an SSO/MFA troubleshooting playbook.

## 🔥 Topics Covered
✅ SAML 2.0 SSO with Entra ID as IdP
✅ Signing certificate trust & rotation risk
✅ Assignment-based access enforcement
✅ Sign-in log troubleshooting (AADSTS codes)
✅ NIST 800-53 + CySA+ mapping
