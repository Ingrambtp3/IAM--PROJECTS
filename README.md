# Identity and Access Management (IAM) Journey 🚀

### Weekly Progress (WEEK 3)
- [Week 3 – Access Reviews in Entra ID][(https://github.com/Ingrambtp3/IAM--PROJECTS/tree/main/Week%203%20Access%20Reviews)]
### ✅ Topics Covered
- Set up and tested Access Reviews to ensure users still need access
- Assigned reviewers and applied decisions to remove unnecessary access
- Practiced governance and cleanup using built-in tools in Entra ID  
### ✅ WEEK 4 – Automating Access Review Insights with PowerShell

In this lab, I automated the process of pulling Access Review decision data using PowerShell and the Microsoft Graph API.  
I authenticated with a custom app registration, queried Access Review instances and decisions, and exported the results to a CSV for auditing.

🛠️ Skills Practiced:
- Microsoft Graph API
- PowerShell scripting
- Identity Governance automation
- Least privilege enforcement
