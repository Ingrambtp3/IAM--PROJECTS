# üõ°Ô∏èWeek 3 ‚Äì Access Reviews in Entra IDüõ°Ô∏è

## Overview
This project focuses on configuring and testing **Access Reviews** in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD). Access Reviews are an essential part of Identity Governance and help ensure users only retain access they actually need.

## Goal‚ö°Ô∏è
To demonstrate how to set up and run an access review for a group or privileged role using Entra ID, with proper remediation actions and review decisions.

## What I Didüõ°Ô∏è
- ‚úÖChose a test group containing users with elevated permissions
- ‚úÖ an Access Review to run for 1 day
- ‚úÖ reviewers (self-review or delegated)
- ‚úÖ decisions (approve/remove access)
- ‚úÖ results and export options

## Key Learnings‚ú®
- How to configure Access Reviews via the Entra portal
- The role of reviewers and review settings (recurrence, auto-apply, justification, etc.)
- How to manage over-privileged users using built-in governance tools
